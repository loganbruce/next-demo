Hey Everyone ! 

This is a quick demo I put together using Next JS as a small introduction. 

To get started and run the app first run 

```bash
npm install
# and then
npm run dev
```

This will install dependencies and start the development server on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Things to note
1. First check out the [Pages] folder. These files relate to routes on the app. For example about.js creates a route [http://localhost:3000/about](http://localhost:3000/about). 
2. Next note the [styles] folder. Styles for pages should go in this folder whereas styles for components should be put together with the component js file. 
3. Speaking of, components allow us to create reusable elements through out app. Similar to lit-html which you would have used in the Vanilla-SPA.
4. The structure and more of the minute details may take some getting used to but as you can see, building up each page is quite similar to the html and css we are already quite used to.
